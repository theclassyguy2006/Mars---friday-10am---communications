Here is the guide from me for the RF 433MHz transmitter project:

These are some steps that I followed the setting up the transmitter with the arduino:-

1. Take Arduino uno, transmitter module, jumper wires.
2. First connect the VDD to the 5V of arduino, and GND pin of tranmitter to the GND of the Arduino.
3. Now connect the DATA pin to any of the analog digits (eg. 12)
4. After connections write the code taking into consideration about the DATA pin connections(i.e. 13)
5. As your code is complete connect the arduino to the laptop to check the code, and start uploading so that
the reciever end will recieve the transmitted message.

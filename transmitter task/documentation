For the MaRS task #2, I chose the communication subgroup.
So the task was to build a transmitter and receiver module and to interface it with Arduino. My job was to connect the RF 433MHz transmitter to the arduino 
and to write the specific code for the same such that it should communicate with receiver module code made by yusuf.

I started with getting some understanding of the transmitter module, its pins and connections. Also I took help from some sources for this information-
1. for understanding all about the RF modules -  https://robu.in/what-is-rf-transmitter-and-receiver//
2. for the connections of transmitter pins    -  https://randomnerdtutorials.com/rf-433mhz-transmitter-receiver-module-with-arduino/

After understanding the basics about the transmitter module and its pins I started to look for the code writting

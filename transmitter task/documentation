For the MaRS task #2, I chose the communication subgroup.
So the task was to build a transmitter and receiver module and to interface it with Arduino. My job was to connect the RF 433MHz transmitter to the arduino 
and to write the specific code for the same such that it should communicate with receiver module code made by yusuf.

I started with getting some understanding of the transmitter module, its pins and connections. Also I took help from some sources for this information-
1. for understanding all about the RF modules -  https://robu.in/what-is-rf-transmitter-and-receiver//
2. for the connections of transmitter pins    -  https://randomnerdtutorials.com/rf-433mhz-transmitter-receiver-module-with-arduino/

After understanding the basics about the transmitter module and its pins I started to look for the code writting. For writting code I took help from some 
sources-
1. for the transmitter code - https://randomnerdtutorials.com/rf-433mhz-transmitter-receiver-module-with-arduino/
2. for RadioHead library download- https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/radio-head.

while reading about how to code for it I got to know that I have to use RadioHead library, because
The RadioHead library provides an easy way to work with the 433 MHz transmitter/receiver with the Arduino

After finishing the code for tranmitter I connected the transmitter module to the arduino, and then connected it to the laptop to start transmitting.
So the code was working and yusuf was receiving the message sent by me.

I also tried to improve my code for taking the input message from the user (i.e like scanf). but i was not getting the proper function for that thing 
(may be because I dont know much anout those functions) . For this code receiver end was receiving the msg but it was showing some random message.

So, overall it was interesting task to do. Also we handeled real arduino for the first time and also successfully transmitted our messages.

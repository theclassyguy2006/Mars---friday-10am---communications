In mars task#2 we were told to create TRANSRECIEVR system which will transmit and recive any type of small data.
I was given Transmitter part of the system. 
I srtarted by first learning about how to connect Transmitter to Arduino.
Then I After successfully connecting the transmitter to Arduino I started to Code.
I wrote my own code with help of certain sites which are mentioned in SOURCE file.
After everything when i tried to run , the message was not delivered to reciver side.
After some time i wrote another simple code , Using same libraries as used in Reciever side code.
Then it worked .
With this I infered that libraries should be same on both side otherwise the system won't work.

Now we were given task to take an Ultrasonic sensor and use it to find distance and transmit the distance.
Then i used my knowledge ,of how to use Ultrasoninc sensor , which i aquired while making one of my projects in task#1 to connect Ultrasonic to Arduino.

After updating the previous code with neccessary changes , the whole system was working.
